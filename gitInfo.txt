1. What is the difference between git and GitHub. 

git is an open source distributed version control system. git allows you to set up working directories and track changes
in the files in the directory. This allows you to develop locally, create banches, log and revert project changes. 
GitHub is an online hosting service for git repos. This allows you to build an collaborate on projects together. This makes it easy for
companys, and open source groups to fork repos, create local copies of the application, and submit pull requests to the master copy.

2. How do you write a commit message. 

You can write a simple commit message by writting the following line:

$ git commit -a

The a flag tells the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not
told Git about are not affected. This command by default opens a vim editior allowing you to write a message decribing the changes in the commit.
It is important that this message highlights the file changes incase you need to trace when errors or issues arise in the application.
